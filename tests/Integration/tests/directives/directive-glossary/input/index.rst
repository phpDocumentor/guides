    environment
        A structure where information about all documents under the root is
        saved, and used for cross-referencing. The environment is pickled
        after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
        and parse new and changed documents.

    source directory
        The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
        source files for one documentation project.
