=============
Configuration
=============

The cli tool is able to read configuration from a ``guides.xml`` file.
You should put this file in the current working directory where you execute
the tool. Generally speaking, this is the root of your project.

Using a configuration file allows you to set project specific settings and
keep them under version control. Not all options available in the configuration
are available on the command line. Such as the :ref:`extension configuration`.

.. note::

    The ``guides.xml`` file is not required. If it is not present, the tool
    will use the default configuration.

Global configuration
====================

Settings that you want to have regardless of the documentation you are
building should live in ``guides.xml`` in the current working directory.

.. literalinclude:: ./basic-config.xml
   :language: xml

See the ``guides.xsd`` file for all available config options.

Extension configuration
=======================

Some extensions allow extra configuration to be added to the ``guides.xml``

.. literalinclude:: ./extension-config.xml
   :language: xml

.. hint::

   If you want to learn more about the extensions, see the :doc:`/developers/extensions/index` documentation.
