About Guides
============

phpDocumentor's Guides library takes hand-written documentation in code repositories, creates an AST from that and feeds
it to a renderer to create the desired output.

As part of this goal, the Guides library itself is more of a framework where you can plug in support for an input
format, such as Restructured Text, and plug in an output format to output towards, such as HTML.
