====================
phpDocumentor Guides
====================

This repository is part of `phpDocumentor's Guides library <https://github.com/phpDocumentor/guides>`__, a framework
designed to take hand-written documentation in code repositories and create an AST (abstract syntax tree) from it.
This AST is then fed to a renderer, which produces the desired output, such as HTML.

The package `phpdocumentor/guides-graphs <https://packagist.org/packages/phpdocumentor/guides-graphs>`__ provides
`Plantuml <https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml>`__ support for restructured text rendered by the phpDocumentor's
Guides library. Using this package is optional.
